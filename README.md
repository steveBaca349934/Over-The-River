# Over-The-River

## Took a crack at game development by writing this game in pure java

## While I did follow a guide on youtube, I modified the code in an attempt to solidify software concepts that I learned in a software development class 
   * Examples of this include making a singleton class (see Game.java), as well as focusing on learning and implementing inheritance concepts from OOP

### Ended up ok, happy with results from first iteration
